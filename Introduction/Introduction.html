    <div id=BodyHeader>The IBM 1620</div>

    <div id=BodyText>

        <p>The IBM 1620 was designed as a small, relatively inexpensive (for its time), decimal, "scientific" computer. It was first released in late 1959. Initially, the system supported only punched paper-tape input and output, plus the console typewriter (which was a modified IBM Model B electric typewriter -- the old style, with type bars and a moving carriage). Shortly thereafter, the IBM 1622 card reader/punch was introduced. It was derived from the IBM 1402 card reader/punch for the IBM 1401 computer, a very popular small business-oriented system.</p>

        <p>Curiously, the Model I did not have circuitry to do addition. Instead, addition was done by looking up the sum of digit pairs from a table in core memory at locations 00300-00399. Multiplication was also done by table lookup from locations 0100-0299. Instructions to do division were not a standard feature, but instructions to do so (known as "automatic division") were available as an extra-cost item. Division for systems without that feature was accomplished through software subroutines.</p>

        <p>In 1963, IBM announced the 1620 Model II system, and the original system became known as the Model I, which was at that point discontinued. Except for a few obscure differences, the Model II could run Model I programs, but the Model II had a faster core memory and redesigned logic circuitry, allowing it to run a program 2-5 times faster than the Model I. It also supported hardware addition, but multiplication was still done by table lookup. The Model II also included as standard, some features that had been extra-cost items on the Model I -- automatic division, indirect addressing, and three additional instructions for data editing.</p>

        <p>The Model II control panel looked the same as the Model I from a distance, but the indicator lamps were arranged and labeled very differently, as a consequence of the very different design of the internal logic circuitry. Perhaps the most noticeable difference was the typewriter -- an IBM Selectric, with its characteristic "golf ball" printing mechanism and non-moving carriage. It printed about 50% faster than the Model I's typewriter.</p>

        <p>Both models supported instructions for automatic floating-point arithmetic as an extra-cost option. Systems without floating point hardware used software subroutines for floating-point calculations. The Model II also supported as extra-cost options, index registers and the so-called "binary capabilities" that could convert the 1620's native decimal (base-10) numbers to and from octal (base-8) notation and perform logical operations -- AND, OR, exclusive-OR, bit-wise complement, and bit testing.</p>

        <p>The 1620 was used as the computing and control component of the IBM 1710 and 1720 process-control systems. In that mode, the 1620 supported interrupts and additional instructions to access various process control interfaces, e.g., analog-to-digital converters, sensing devices, and switch controllers.<p>

        <p>IBM discontinued support for the 1620 systems in 1970 and began steering their customers toward their new IBM 360 series of systems. In total about 2,000 1620 systems were built, about half Model Is and half Model IIs.</p>

    <div id=BodyHeader>The IBM 1620 Project Team</div>

    <div id=BodyText>

        <p>The Computer History Museum's IBM 1620 team was formed in the Fall of 1998 with the two goals of restoring the museum's IBM 1620 Model 1 computer to operation and collecting as much information and material on the IBM 1620 as possible.  Dave Babcock, CHM Volunteer, has been the project leader since the beginning.  Joe Crespo, IBM 1620 design engineer, proposed the restoration and contributed to the initial project planning.  Len Shustek, CHM Founder &amp; CEO, was the project's sponsor.  Dag Spicer, CHM Curator, provided valuable assistance and support.  Paul Lasewicz, IBM Corporate Archivist, provided copies of their archived material and legal permission from Lou Gerstner, IBM CEO, to put all IBM-copyrighted IBM 1620 material on this website.  David Wise, IBM 1620 owner, shared his experience &amp; knowledge from restoring his personal IBM 1620 and designed &amp; built the Peripheral Emulator.  Dr. John Maniotes donated 4 filing cabinets of IBM 1620 software on punched cards and 20 boxes of manuals and other documentation.  The project was successful and is documented <a href=../Restoration/Restoration.html>here</a>.

        <p>A subset of the team started a new project in 2016 to build a functional replica of the IBM 1620 using modern components, called the IBM 1620 Jr.  It utilizes a spare IBM 1620 front panel from a Model 1 Level C machine, and reproduces the Model 1 Level F machine that the team restored.  All incandescent lights were replaced with similar-looking LEDs.  The toggle switches, whose plastic handles often broke on the real machines, were replaced with metal-handled, heavy duty, look-alike switches.  A cycle-level, authentic speed, simulator program, written in C following the 1620's actual logic diagrams, runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ which drives the hardware.  The result is a replica that passes the "Parroty Check".  That is, put side-by-side with the restored 1620, one cannot detect any difference in look, feel, or operation between the two computers.  Junior also includes an emulated console typewriter and an 1/7th scale simulation of the IBM 1622 card reader/punch for input &amp; output.  That project is documented <a href=../Junior/Junior.html>here</a>.

        <p>The team members are: Dave Babcock, Charles Benner, Ken Cairns, Steve Casner, Mike Cheponis, Tim Coslet, Lee Courtney, Joe Crespo, Joe Fredrick, Richard Jowsey, Paul Kimpel, Don Krehbiel, Bruce MacKinnon, Bill Maddox, Dr. John Maniotes, Maury Pepper, Todd Pisek, John Sansone, Len Shustek, Eric Smith, Dag Spicer, Paul Williamson, and David Wise.</p>

    <div id=BodyText>

        <p>The development of this website was a collaborative effort by Dave Babcock and Paul Kimpel.  Dave had the original, rough design concept.  Paul then improved the design and masterfully created the HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation.  Finally, Dave curated and added the content that's been collected by the project team over 25 years.</p>

        <p>On this website, the term "IBM 1620" will be used generically to represent all variations of the machine including the IBM 1620 Model I (all product levels), IBM 1620 Model II, IBM 1710, and IBM 1720.</p>

        <p>All PDF files on this website have been OCR'd and are searchable.</p>

    <div id=BodyText>

        <p>This site was designed to be easy and intuitive to navigate.</p>

        <p>On the home page, clicking on any of the selector knob labels will go to that section of this website.  Holding down the pointer within the selector cup "grabs" the knob and it can be rotated by moving the pointer.  Releasing the pointer will go to the selected section of this website.  Clicking on the system photo will expand the image.  Clicking on the CHM logo will go to the museum's home page.</p>

        <p>All of the section pages share the same header.  Clicking on "IBM 1620 ARCHIVE" title will go back to this website's home page.  Clicking on the selector icon in the header will display a pull-down menu of the main sections of this site.  Clicking on any section will go to that section.</p>

        <p>Throughout this website, links to other website pages, documents, and files appear as underlined blue text or highlighted images.  Note that in some cases, a document, piece of software, or other information is known to exist, but an electronic copy of it isn't available.</p>

        <p>Most data tables can be sorted by clicking on blue, underlined column headers.  The sort algorithm used is stable, meaning the data can be sorted by multiple columns.  Do this by selecting the columns from the least important key to the most important key.  Just like a vintage punched card sorter.</p>
