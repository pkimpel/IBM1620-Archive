        <p>Detailed information about the IBM 1620 Data Processing System installations no longer exists.</p>

        <p>IBM physically destroyed all design, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and maintenance records after storing them for many years at the Iron Mountain facility in Felton, California.</p>

        <p>The best estimates are that approximately 2,000 IBM 1620 systems were produced - half of them Model 1 and half Model 2 - and several hundred IBM 1710 systems were built.  It is known that only 3 IBM 1720 systems existed.  There is no estimate of how many systems were sold versus leased.  At their end-of-life, all leased machines were physically destroyed when returned to keep them from the secondary market.  It was not uncommon for purchased machines to be "handed down" to junior colleges and high schools when replaced with newer, more powerful systems.</p>

        <p>Very few IBM 1620s still exist.  Most are in museums, a few are owned by private collectors.  Some systems were cannibalized for their iconic front panel.  The known remaining 1620s are listed <a href="./Remaining/Remaining.html">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The magazine "Computers and Automation" published a census of world-wide counts of installed computers every few months during the IBM 1620's lifetime.  The census was based on end-user surveys.  The counts were only as good as the surveys returned.  The census counts do not include the number of IBM 1620 computers that IBM had installed internally or any IBM 1710 / 1720 systems.  Other publications also published computer surveys, but on an irregular basis.  It's remarkable that so many government locations, companies, organizations, and schools would freely release information about what computers they had.  These censuses can be found <a href="./Census/Census.html">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The following list of known installations was derived from many sources including membership lists of the IBM 1620 User Groups &amp; COMMON, papers, magazine &amp; newspaper articles, press releases, industry surveys, and personal accounts.  For most locations, nothing is known about the model, options, or peripherals, just that an IBM 1620 was there.</p>

        <p>Here is the map of the known installations:</p>
