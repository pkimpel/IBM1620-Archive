The IBM 1620 was a 1960s transistorized, decimal, variable field-length, magnetic-core memory computer system designed primarily as an inexpensive solution for scientific and engineering applications. There were two models, the original Model 1 released in 1959, and the object-code compatible but significantly redesigned Model 2, released in 1962. A total of about 2,000 systems were produced, roughly half each Model-1s and Model-2s. IBM supported the system until 1970.

This repository holds the scripts and other resources for the web site that provides access to the archive documents, software, and other materials, but does not contain those materials.
